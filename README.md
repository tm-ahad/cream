# Cream

Cream is a compiler that enables you to write frontend user interfaces with declarative code and compiles to HTML. It offers a modern approach to building web applications, with features designed to enhance productivity and performance.

## Introduction

Cream simplifies frontend development by providing a straightforward way to write UI code using a declarative syntax. With Cream, you can create reactive user interfaces with minimal overhead, resulting in faster development cycles and more maintainable code.

## Features

- **Compiled JavaScript with Zero Abstraction**: Cream generates JavaScript code without introducing unnecessary abstractions, resulting in efficient and maintainable code.
  
- **All-in-One HTML File**: All JavaScript and markup are embedded in a single HTML file, simplifying deployment and distribution of applications.
  
- **Reactive States Without Weird APIs**: Cream provides reactive state management without relying on complex or unfamiliar APIs, making it easy to manage application state.
  
- **Very Small JavaScript Script with Zero Dependencies**: Cream produces lightweight JavaScript code with no external dependencies, ensuring fast load times and minimal overhead.
  
- **Standard Library**: Cream includes a standard library with functions for tasks such as fetching data, error handling, data extraction, hashing, and cycling data, streamlining common development tasks.
  
- **Build Full-Stack Web Apps**: Cream can be used to build full-stack web applications in conjunction with any backend framework, offering flexibility and interoperability.
  
- **No `node_modules` Required**: Cream does not rely on `node_modules` for its functionality, eliminating unnecessary dependencies and simplifying project setup. This is particularly beneficial for projects that do not use TypeScript or Tailwind CSS.
  
- **Blazingly Fast and Memory Safe**: Cream is built with Rust, providing excellent performance, memory safety, and reliability.
  
- **Relatively Newer Syntax**: Cream introduces a modern syntax that is easy to learn and use, providing developers with powerful language features and expressive constructs.
  
- **No Bundler Required**: Cream eliminates the need for bundlers, enabling simpler and more efficient build processes.
